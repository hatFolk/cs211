The Final is on Monday, 12/16 at 1:30-4:15.

The Final Exam has the ability to Replace Exam2's grade if the difference in
points is 14.

Notes about the Final
=====================
It will cover regex, recursion, and easy to grade questions.
You will not have to write large classes, trace through code and give output,
and will likely not feature hide-and-seek compilation errors.
It will probably be closer to "Look, fix this code!".
Also, you should probably know the Comparable interface.
Obviously, you should know how to trace memory anyway.
You do need to know what can(not) cause compilation error.
And there will always be code writing.

The exam will be longer than any other exams previous due to it being the
Final Exam.

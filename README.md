The Final is on Monday, 12/16 at 1:30-4:15.

The Final Exam has the ability to Replace Exam2's grade if the difference in
points is 14.

Notes about the Final
=====================
It will cover regex, recursion, and easy to grade questions.
You will not have to write large classes, trace through code and give output,
and will likely not feature hide-and-seek compilation errors.
It will probably be closer to "Look, fix this code!".
Also, you should probably know the Comparable interface.

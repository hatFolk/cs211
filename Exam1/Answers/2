2. Give the output for Test.java (you can assume the toString method of Object
returns a String such as "[0x0123456]" which refers to a memory address. It
doesn't matter what it actually is.

	a. Write the output below:
		Memory Address for Object
		Kinga
		3

	b. Explain what polymorphism is in Java using the example above.
		Polymorphism is when you can use child objects as though
		they were parent objects. In this case, all of the objects in the
		ArrayList were all subclasses of Object and therefore, it was okay
		to make that for loop and call them all as Object.

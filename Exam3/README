This is Dr. Kinga Dobolyi's CS211 Final 2011.
Each of these folders contain each question and relevant files for each.
These are to be used for the ease of studying.
Question 2, 3, 4, 5 are short answers and do not need their own folders.
Changed folders to text files 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

Notes about the Final:
Covers regex, recursion, and easy to grade questions
Won't need to write out large classes, trace through code, or give output.

Probably will rely more on "Look, Code. How do I fix it?"
Know how the comparable interface works.

5. Now list one drawback or "thing we have to be careful about otherwise it
will cause a compilation/runtime error" each, as we have discussed in class,
of the following concepts. Each answer must be appreciably different from the 
rest.
    a. Static fields

		Any object can acciddentally modify the shared static field

    b. Primitive arrays

		Can't grow in size

    c. Private methods

		Other classes can't call private methods.

    d. Public fields

		If you change the type of the public field, you may break other code
		outside of the class

    e. Private fields

		Need getters and setters to access private fields

    f. Passing an argument by reference

		The method may accidentally change the object passed as an argument

    g. Constructors

		A child class must call the parent's ctor through super

    h. Interfaces

		Interfaces can't have any private attributes

    i. Inheritance

		You can only extend one class at a time

    j. Abstract classes

		You can't call the constructor of an abstract class.

4. List one benefit each, as we have discussed in class, of the following
concepts (can be a phrase). Each benefit must be different from all of the 
others for full credit.
    a. Static fields

		You save memory by sharing across multiple classes

    b. Primitive arrays

		Access time is constant. Uses less memory than any other collection.

    c. Private methods

		When you want to break up code into smaller methods without having
		those methods available to other classes.

    d. Public fields

		Wide usability and doesn't need getters or setters.

    e. Private fields

		Promotes encapsulations and information hiding.

    f. Passing an argument by reference

		Allows for the editting of the object rather than a copy of the object
		Saves time and space.

    g. Constructors

		Initialize all fields in one method rather than calling setters.

    h. Interfaces

		You can implement multiple interfaces (but can only extend once)

    i. Inheritance

		Removes duplicate code into a parent class

    j. Abstract classes

		You want inheritance but don't want to create objects because of
		incompleteness.

6. Examine the four classes (Final1, Person, Student, GradStudent.java)

	a. What is the output of the code?

		person: Kinga
		person student: David
		person student: John

	b. Change the code above to make people a list of objects. That is, remove
	the restriction that people can only store Person objects. Make sure the
	rest of the classes compile, after making this change (which might lead to
	more changes).

		ArrayList<Person> people = new ArrayList<Person>();
				// becomes
		ArrayList people = new ArrayList();
				// and
		people.get(i).print();
				// becomes
		((Person) people.get(i)).print();

	c. Answer the following questions about short-circuiting in Java:
		What is short-circuiting:

			Short circuiting is when only one clause of the boolean
			operator is evaluated (left to right) and the right
			clauses are skipped because the answer is already known.

		An example of short-circuiting in an if-statement:

			if (true || 3==4)

		Short circuiting is useful because:

			Saves time by preventing unnecessary instructions.

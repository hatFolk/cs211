Imagine we have a linked list and an array each storing 100 Strings.
The array is at maximum capcity. Assume efficient implementations (and
document them)

1. Which one would use more memory, when not being accessed/modified?

2. Which one would use more memory during the operation of adding a new
element?

3. Which one would need more instructions to add a new element (both are
unsorted)?

5. Imagine that instead of a binary tree, we have a tree that has three child
nodes instead of just two. The nodes in this tree are unsorted. Complete the
recursive method below to print out all nodes of the tree, assuming that you
call the method on the root of the tree. The parent nodes should always be
printed before any of their child nodes.

Start with:

public void printNode(Node curr){
	if(curr == null){
		return;
	} else {
		System.out.println(curr.getValue());
		for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
			printNode(curr.getChildren()[i]);
		}
	}
}

7. Complete the following method to find the minimum value of the objects in
the list arrayList. The method should return the element with the minimum
value. You may NOT use the Collections.sort method or any other sorting
algorithm, for this question (i.e. implementing BubbleSort or anything is both
not allowed and only makes things harder). Note that you don't know what type
of objects are in arrayList, only that they implmement the Comparable
interface. This question is potentially non-obvious- save it until the end.

Start with:
public Object findMin(ArrayList<Comparable> arrayList){	
/*
 * size = 0 ?
 * size = 1		[2] -> [2]
 * size = 2		[2, 1] -> [1]
 * size = 2		[1, 2] -> [1]
 * size = 3		[1, 2, 3] -> [1]
 * size = 3		[3, 2, 1] -> [1]
 * size = 3		[3, 1, 2] -> [1]
 * size = 3		[3, -1, 2] -> [-1]
 * size = 5		[5, 3, 7, 2, 4] -> [2]
 *
 */
	Comparable smallest = arrayList.get(0);
	for(int i=0; i< arrayList.size(); i++){
		Comparable current = arrayList.get(i);
		if (smallest.compareTo(current) > 0){
			smallest = current;
		}
	}
	return smallest
}
